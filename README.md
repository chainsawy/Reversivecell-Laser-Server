## Reversivecell.Laser - Project
***Reversivecell.Laser*** is a Brawl Stars Server. It was written by myself. The goal of this server was to implement all the features of Brawl Stars and support millions of players. Reversivecell.Laser uses dedicated threads and async operators. Couchbase servers & a memory based saving server will be used to save players.

#### About us
I probably won't update the git. I don't have time with the studies to work on it anymore. If you have any questions, you can contact me on discord (@xeondev#8971). You can use it to create your own private server if you wish. The current version has some logic bugs and not implemented features. Here is a project that uses this version: https://t.me/reversive. I offer partnerships that allow you to have your own private server.
